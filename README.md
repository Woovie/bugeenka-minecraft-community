Modpack: [Valhelsia 6](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/valhelsia-6) version 6.2.3

## Server

Using itzg/minecraft in a container, see `docker-compose.yaml`

## Recommended client installation

1. Install [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher) for easy mod installation. Latest version will work. Look for "Releases" on the right side of the page and click the name of the verison next to "Latest". I'd recommend a build with `PrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC-arm64-Setup` in the name for easy installation.
1. Once install is done, open Prism and sign in to your Microsoft account via the "Accounts" menu in the upper right of the main UI.
1. Once signed in, click "Add Instance", choose "Curseforge" from the left menu, then search for Valhelsia 6. Ensure you choose version 6.2.3 from the dropdown box, and then click OK. Prism will then download all of the required mod files for the mod.

This modpack as well comes with some advertising and microtransaction junk, so if you wish to remove those (I'd recommend it), right click the Valhelsia instance and choose Edit. Click the Mods tab and uncheck these mods:

- BHMenu
- FancyMenu
- Essential Mod

> This Edit UI also will let you increase memory limits for Java under the Settings tab near the bottom. I set my upper memory to 16384, but not necessarily required.

Click Close to save your changes. You can now launch the instance and join our server. See the Discord for server information to avoid it being too public.
